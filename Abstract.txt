Abstract and Interface
......................

1.Abstract is pure virtual class and method without body.
2.If a class abstract ,object of abstract class cannot be created.
3.The abstract class should be inherited and overridden by abstract method.
4.Object of the sub class should be created with super class reference.
5.If the class is abstract, method need not be abstract.
6.If the method became abstract then its corresponding class should be abstract.
7.Abstract class have two methods concrete and non concrete methods.
8.Non concrete methods declared but not defined in the class,this method is abstract.
9.Abstract class or method can be inherited.
10.Abstract class or method can not be declared as protected & private.
11.One abstract class can extends another abstract class but,class that extends final class then it has to over ridden all the methods in it.
12.Abstract class can have constructor and instance variable.

Interface 
.........

1.Interface is a pure abstraction,only abstract methods.
2.Interface allows the run time polymorphism.super class reference with sub class object.
3.One interface can extends another interface.
4.Class cannot extends interface, but it can only implements.
5.Integration is easy between different project.
6.After compilation of interface it became abstract interface .
7.One class implements multiple interface.
8.There is no constructor in the interface,because then it will became body for interface.
9.Variable in interface after compilation it will become final(constant) by default.
10.Variable in interface can be used before the object creation because it became class variable by default.
11.The reference should be create to the sub class where the Interface has the "implements" of the parent class.


create a class employee name age address,create two object of employee class and store data in it and compare the two objects and say wheater both are same or different.
